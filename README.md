# My collection

A react app I made to sell reworked/recycled clothing items for more affordable prices and promote sustainable fashion. 


* It takes 3,781 liters of water to make a pair of jeans. 2,700 liters of water to make one cotton shirt.
* 92 million tons of textile waste is created each year - the equivalent to a truck full of clothing ending up on a landfill every second.
* Textiles can take up to 200+ years to decompose in landfills.


The fashion industry needs to reinvent itself and we need to look at clothing items more sustainably. Rather than buying a shirt and wearing it for a week, wear it, then donate, rework, or sell it.
